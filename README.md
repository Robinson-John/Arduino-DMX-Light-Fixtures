## DMX Lighting Fixtures

This project is a personal experiment to learn about DMX control.

Project Goal: 
    Use a DMX lighting control board to control a series of Arduino's processing that DMX signal and create lighting effects to enhance my D&D games. The first of these fixtures will be a Neopixel RGB strip that runs the length of the table to both give ambient lighting and to act as a turn indicator.


Project Milestones:  
[x] Control Neopixel strip with arduino  
[x] Successfully process incoming DMX signal on Arduino  
[x] Use incoming DMX signal to control individual LEDs that each have unique DMX addresses  
[] Use incoming DMX signal to control entire strip as one unit  
[] 3D print diffuser for LED strip  
[] Daisy chain 3 Neopixel strips to run the length of my D&D table  
[] Create additional lighting fixture to project lights onto ceiling
